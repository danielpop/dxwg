      This document reports on evidence and implementations of the revised edition of the Data Catalog vocabulary (DCAT) Candidate Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]]. In particular, it demonstrates that the classes and properties revised and defined in [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] are already in use and are also implementable.</section>

      <p class="ednote">TBD: What is DCAT; why a revision was needed; what has been revised; how implementation evidence was collected.</p>
<!--      
      <p>One of the main goals of the Data on the Web Best Practices (<a href="http://w3.org/TR/dwbp">DWBP</a>) is to facilitate interaction between publishers and consumers of data on the Web. A set of 35 Best Practices were created to cover different <a data-cite="VOCAB-DCAT-2#challenges">challenges</a> related to data publishing and consumption, such as Metadata, Data licenses, Data provenance, Data quality, Data versioning, Data identification, Data formats, Data vocabularies, Data access and APIs, Data preservation, Feedback, Data enrichment and Data republication. </p>

      <p>To show that the DWBP are implementable as well broadly adopted and referenced by well-known organizations, we collected evidence in the form of datasets, data portals, documents, references and guidelines (<a href="#list-of-evidence">Section 2</a>). We used two forms to collect this evidence: (<a href="http://w3c.br/form-dwbp/">DWBP evidence form</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l_imkvTjIRizyQl23HnBP2FFzO_cx4Uvm2i7q5KbpCM/edit#gid=0">DWBP template form</a>). The results are summarized in this report.</p>

      <p> Besides the results collected from the surveys, in order to strengthen the DWBP adoption evidence, we also present our evaluation of how DWBP are currently being adopted by the major data catalog solutions, including <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, <a href="https://socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, <a href="http://www.nucivic.com/dkan/">DKAN</a>, <a href="http://www.junar.com">JUNAR</a>, <a href="http://opendata.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS Open Data</a> and <a href="https://www.opendatasoft.com/">OPENDATASOFT</a> (<a href="#DWBP-Catalogues">Section 3</a>). Finally, we also present some examples to illustrate that each one of the DWBP is implementable (<a href="#DWBP-Examples">Section 4</a>).

      <section>
        <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
        <p>We followed the steps described below to collect evidence for the revised edition of DCAT:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Review existing vocabularies based on [[VOCAB-DCAT]], and identify if they include already the changes proposed in the revised edition of DCAT.</li>
        <li>Review existing guidelines and implementation reports of [[VOCAB-DCAT]], as well as of vocabularies based on it, to verify if the changes proposed in the revised edition of DCAT are implemented in existing data catalogues.</li>
<!--        
        <li>A review of the collected implementations was made in order to check which best practices should have more implementations.</li>
        <li>A detailed review of the implementations as well as the comments received through the surveys were made in order to prepare the implementation report.</li>
-->        
        <li>The Implementation Report was developed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As noted, to have a broader coverage of the [[VOCAB-DCAT-2]] adoption we considered different types of evidence:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Datasets, Data Portals and Vocabularies</strong>: this type of evidence shows that the proposed revisions to [[VOCAB-DCAT]] were already considered by organizations responsible for publishing data on the Web. </li>
        <li><strong>Documents and References</strong>: this category includes Web sites, Web pages, blogs, published papers, APIs documentation, projects and wikis. This type of evidence shows the adoption of the proposed revisions to [[VOCAB-DCAT]] in more general scenarios.<br>
        <li><strong>Guidelines</strong>: these guidelines were proposed by governmental organizations to help data publishers to make data available on the Web. Each guideline discusses and proposes practices that makes an explicit) reference to a DWBP or where the advice offered is fully consistent with the relevant proposed revision to [[VOCAB-DCAT]].</p>

        <h3 id="exit-criteria">Meeting the exit criteria</h3>
        <p>As described in the <abbr title="Dataset Exchange Working Group">DXWG</abbr> <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter">charter</a>, to move on to Proposed Recommendation, evidence will be adduced in order to demonstrate that each of the changes made to the original DCAT Recommendation [[VOCAB-DCAT]] has two independent implementations. Evidence of implementation was gathered from existing datasets and data portals, which already implement the proposed changes, as well as from existing application profiles of [[VOCAB-DCAT]].</p>

      <h3>General analysis</h3>
        <p>One of our main concerns when we started to collect evidence for each one of the DWBP was to have implementations from well-known organizations as well as high profile datasets and data portals worldwide, like <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">Data.gov.uk</a>, <a href="https://data.gov/">Data.gov</a> and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/"> World Bank</a>. Analyzing the tables presented in the previous section, we can say that we accomplished this goal. The DWBP evidence were collected from well-known organizations and projects including the ones mentioned before as well as BBC, Twitter, Europeana, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and OpenStreetMaps. Considering the geographical coverage, we collected implementations from several countries, including Brazil, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Spain, UK, USA and Italy. It is also important to notice that evidence in the form of guidelines concerns several governmental organizations from Europe. Other important characteristic from the DWBP implementations is their broad domain coverage, e.g. they refer to different domains, like Government, Environment and Healthcare, as described in the graphic below.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">Evidence count per domain</div>
            <div class="panel-body"> <canvas id="graficoPieDom"></canvas> </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <p>As we can observe in the graphic below, there is a broad adoption of DWBP related to Metadata (<a href="#BP1">BP1</a> and <a href="#BP2">BP2</a>), Data Licenses (<a href="#BP4">BP4</a>), Data Identification (<a href="#BP9">BP9</a> and <a href="#BP10">BP10</a>), Data Formats (<a href="#BP12">BP12</a> and <a href="#BP14">BP14</a>), Vocabularies (<a href="#BP15">BP15</a> and <a href="#BP16">BP16</a>), Data Access (<a href="#BP23">BP23</a>, <a href="#BP24">BP24</a>, <a href="#BP25">BP25</a> and <a href="#BP26">BP26</a>) and Feedback (<a href="#BP29">BP29</a>). On the other hand, for others, such as Preserve identifiers (<a href="#BP27">BP27</a>), Assess dataset coverage (<a href="#BP28">BP28</a>), Provide real-time access (<a href="#BP20">BP20</a>) and Provide an explanation for data that is not available (<a href="#BP22">BP22</a>), collection of evidence was more difficult, especially related to datasets and data portals. This can be justified by comments received during the evidence gathering process and also available in the <a href="http://w3c.br/visualizar-evidencias/">DWBP evidence form</a>. Bill Roberts from the SWIRRL, for example, made the following comment about one of the Data Preservation best practices: "Too difficult to test in a meaningful way. In this system, no datasets have yet been taken offline, so the archiving process has not been developed." In the same way, he made a comment about the Best Practice Provide real-time access: "The system does not currently hold dataset collected in 'real time'. Generally the data is statistical in nature and goes through a slower collection and processing cycle."</p>

        <!--<p>On the other hand, it was easier to collect evidence to show the broadly adoption of the DWBP related to Metadata, Vocabularies Reuse, Data Formats, License, Data Identifiers, APIs, Feedback, and Data Enrichment, has a lot of evidences showing that these Best Practices are broadly adopted. 

        In the following, we list some comments received during the DWBP implementation phase:
        <ol>
        <li> In the case of Metadata we received a comment explaining that "A DCAT profile is provided in order to document the metadata". </li>
        <li> About  Data Formats, was said for instance that "Currency values etc are provided together with units." and "Data is available as RDF in a number of serialisation formats." </li>
        <li> Considering the reuse of vocabularies, we received a comment saying that "A number of standard vocabularies are re-used, notably DCAT, RDF Data Cube, DCMI Terms." </li>
        <li> In the case of Data Identifiers was mentioned that "The dataset contents are provided as Linked Data, with (reasonably) persistent identifiers for geographical areas, time intervals and other statistical dimension values." </li>
        <li> Regarding License was said that "The license is provided in a machine readable form via the property and in human readable form "The license is provided in a machine readable form via the property and in human readable form." </li>
        </ol> -->
        </p>
    </section>  
    <section>
      <h2>DCAT and data catalog platforms</h2>
      
      <p>In this section we present some more evidence that shows the support to the proposed revisions to [[VOCAB-DCAT]]. Rather than specific datasets or data catalogs, we use the following data catalog solutions as evidence: <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, <a href="https://socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, <a href="http://www.nucivic.com/dkan/">DKAN</a>, <a href="http://www.junar.com">JUNAR</a>, <a href="http://opendata.arcgis.com/">ArcGIS Open Data</a> and <a href="https://www.opendatasoft.com/">OPENDATASOFT</a>. For each one of the proposed revisions to [[VOCAB-DCAT]], we show the list of data catalog solutions that implement it.</p>
      
        <table id="table-bp-datacatalogue" class="dwbp-ir-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>BP</th>
              <th>Data Catalogs</th>
              <th>Total</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>As we may notice, there is no evidence for some of the proposed revisions. 
<!--        
        This happens because these Best Practices do not concern the solution used for making the data available on the Web, e.g. the data catalog solution, as explained below.

        <ul>
          <li> BP10, BP16, BP22, BP28: these BP apply to the data itself rather than the data catalog solution used to publish the data. </li>
          <li> BP33, B34, BP35: these BP apply to situations of data republication, i.e. it depends from the consumer rather than the data catalog solution used to publish the data. </li>
          <li> BP31: this BP concerns processes that can be used to enhance, refine or otherwise improve raw or previously processed data, which are not part of the basic data catalog functions.
        </ul>

        <p> Concerning BP27 none of the data catalog solutions implement it. In general, when a dataset is not available then just a 404 error message is returned. </p>
        
        <p>Some Best Practices related to metadata are partially implemented by the data catalog solutions. Note that almost all data catalog solutions are compatible with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>, which means that metadata covered by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> may be completely or partially available both in human-readable and machine-readable formats. In general, it means that just a human-readable or a machine-readable version of the metadata is available, as detailed in the following.
    
        <ul>
          <li>BP3 is partially implemented by CKAN and JUNAR because they do not offer an explicit way to present human-readable structural metadata. </li>
          <li>BP4 and BP5 are partially implemented by ARCGIS OPEN DATA and OPENDATASOFT because it does not offer a way to represent machine-readable license metadata and machine-readable provenance metadata. </li>
          <li>BP8 is partially implemented by SOCRATA because it does not offer a way to represent machine-readable version history metadata. </li>
          <li>BP13 is partially implemented by OPENDATASOFT because it does not offer a way to represent machine-readable language metadata. </li>
        </ul>
-->
<p class="ednote">
The following analysis of data catalog platforms may be relevant also to the revised edition of DCAT, so we can cite it.
</p>

        <p>As a general analysis with regards to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#challenges">Data on the Web Challenges</a>, we can say that Metadata, Data Licenses and Data Formats challenges are a main concern of the data catalog solutions. The Data Access challenge has also been recognized as an important one except when it concerns real-time data. The use of Data Access APIs is a consensus. The major data catalog solutions also deal with the Data Identification challenge, however just part of the problem has been solved. The Data Vocabularies challenge has also been considered as an important one since data catalog solutions reuse existing vocabularies, e.g. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>, when publishing metadata about the data catalogs. Other challenges like Data Provenance, Data Versioning and Feedback have been superficially dealt with in the data catalog solutions. In general, Data Quality, Data Preservation, Data Enrichment and Data Republications are challenges still not explored by the major data catalog solutions.</p>

      <h2 id="DWBP-Examples">DWBP Examples</h2>
      <p>Besides the evidence described earlier, we also worked on examples to show how to use the DWBP in more specific scenarios and also to show that the DWBP are implementable.</p>

      <p><strong> Example 01: Publishing and consuming budget data about Recife.</a> </strong></p>

      <ul>
      <li>Step 1.1 Publication of the first version of the dataset: this step corresponds to the publication of a dataset about budget data from the city of Recife from 2014 to 2015. The data to be published was collected from an existing data portal and it was published according to the DWBP. In order provide a locale neutral data representation, a new attribute (currency) was included as part of the structural metadata. An email was also sent to the original data publisher informing some problems with the dataset. Due to privacy reasons, data values from one of the columns were removed, but a proper explanation was given. After analyzing the data, some null values were replaced in order to enrich the data. During this step, the following DWBP were implemented: <a href="#BP1">BP1</a>, <a href="#BP1">BP2</a>, <a href="#BP1">BP3</a>, <a href="#BP4">BP4</a>, <a href="#BP5">BP5</a>, <a href="#BP6">BP6</a>, <a href="#BP7">BP7</a>, <a href="#BP9">BP9</a>, <a href="#BP12">BP12</a>, <a href="#BP13">BP13</a>, <a href="#BP14">BP14</a>, <a href="#BP17">BP17</a>, <a href="#BP22">BP22</a>, <a href="#BP29">BP29</a>, <a href="#BP31">BP31</a>, <a href="#BP32">BP32</a>, <a href="#BP33">BP33, <a href="#BP34">BP34</a> and <a href="#BP35">BP35</a>. The Budget Dataset is available <a href="http://cin.ufpe.br/~dwbp/dataset/orcamento-2016-11-01/"> here. </a></li>
      
      <li>Step 1.2: Publication of a new version of the dataset: a new version of the Budget Dataset is published to include budget data from 2016. Besides, subsets of the dataset were created to facilitate data access. During this step, the following DWBP were implemented: <a href="#BP8">BP8</a>, <a href="#BP11">BP11</a> and <a href="#BP18">BP18</a>. The new version of the Budget Dataset is available <a href="http://cin.ufpe.br/~dwbp/dataset/orcamento-2016-11-08/"> here</a>.</li>
      
      <li>Step 1.3 Creation of a RDF distribution: During this step, the following DWBP were implemented: <a href="#BP10">B10</a>, <a href="#BP15">BP15</a>, <a href="#BP16">BP16 </a> and <a href="#BP28">B28 </a>.</li>
      
      <li>Step 1.4 Creation of an API: During this step, the following DWBP were implemented: <a href="#BP19">B19</a>, <a href="#BP23">BP23</a>, <a href="#BP24">BP24</a>, <a href="#BP25">BP25</a>, <a href="#BP26">BP26</a>.</li>
      
      <li>Step 1.5 Publishing a new version of the dataset, temporally removing the first version of the dataset and showing feedback previously collected: a new version of the Budget Dataset is published after resolving some codifications problems and the version 1.0 of the dataset is temporally unavailable. It is also possible to see some feedback previously collected from data consumers. During this step, the following DWBP were implemented: <a href="#BP27">BP27</a> and <a href="#BP30">BP30</a>.The new version of the Budget Dataset is available <a href="http://cin.ufpe.br/~dwbp/dataset/orcamento-2016-11-15/"> here.</a></li>
      
      <li>Step 1.6 Creation of an API to provide real time data about budget data from Recife: During this step, the following DWBP was implemented: <a href="#BP20">BP20</a></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p> to include: BP21</p>
